## Why Heart-Disease-Prediction?
The correct prediction of heart disease can prevent life threats, and incorrect prediction can prove to be fatal at the same time. Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Today, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide with 17.9 million deaths annually, as per the World Health Organization reports. Various unhealthy activities are the reason for the increase in the risk of heart disease like high cholesterol, obesity, increase in triglycerides levels, hypertension, etc.But as time is passing, a lot of research data and patients records of hospitals are available. There are many open sources for accessing the patientâ€™s records and researches can be conducted so that various computer technologies could be used for doing the correct diagnosis of the patients and detect this disease to stop it from becoming fatal. In machine learning, a common problem is the high dimensionality of the data; the datasets which we use contain huge data and sometimes we cannot view that data even in 3D, which is also called the curse of dimensionality
